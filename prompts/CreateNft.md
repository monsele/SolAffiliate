Create a new page where a user can create an NFT.
This page will include a form where users enter 
Name, Symbol, description, upload a image file and an option to add the metadata url if the user does not have an image
A button to then create the NFT



{
    "name": "Preme",
    "symbol": "SLMAO",
    "description": "Jusysyss",
    "metadataUrl": "",
    "file": {}
}


This is a page in my solana app where a user can see all the NFTs and then select one that will be used to later create what I call a campaign.
Can you help build out the feature where I can see the NFTS in my wallet. The app is a solana dapp. its a react vite project. At the moment we are just working with dummy data
